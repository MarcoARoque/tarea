In case you need it for a FAST gift.','I bought this pack of Starbucks Gift cards in 2019. Ive given them to friends and I gave 2 to my daughter.My daughter used one recently and it had 6.52 on the card not $10.00. She had the cashier check the balance of the other card and it had $5.32 on it! She had forgotten that she had these gift cards so yes 2 years later decided to use the when she found them! Do they decline in value? And then both had random amounts on them! Im embarrassed now to have given them as gifts! Friends receiving the gift card arent going to tell you that werent able to cover their order with the card you gave them!!!',' That snowman tin is adorable',' Great and easy gift', 'Super cute nice quality tin Your choose amount',' They love it !!', 'So many people Make your life better so remember them!',' My grandson inlaw loves his gift cards so its the perfect gift for Christmas',' What can you say about a gift card?

Highly recommend.',' Really easy to load',' Same gift as her big sisters, this little one can choose the exact thing she most desires and run to the door for three days in anticipation.  A combined birthday and Christmas present for one who knows her own mind.  Good choice!',' Purchasing an Amazon gift card came with an added monetary value but no more.A Bronx cheer for you!',' This is near where I work and has a drive through.

Wonderful gift for any occasion.',' Perfect gift for your kids!',' This is a simple gift to friends or family. For me it was easy to setup. Took ok only about 30 seconds. I also redeem Visa gifts by giving the gift card to myself. I like there isnt a fee. I do want Amazon to make some cooler cards with my animation when a receiver gets it.',' Bonus, recd a promo from Amazon for reloading gift card.  Yeah.<br ><br >Gift card was posted to my account quickly.',' Nice way to save a few bucks overtime by reloading your own gift card.',' Who wouldnt want an Amazon gift card?  The box foretold the contents, lol.',' I only used the $50 card one time at Burger King. It was difficult to use. Must be run as credit, not as gift card. No remaining balance is given at the end of the transaction. And although its on me, I misplaced or lost this card after only spending about $6 of it. I was hoping that the seller could provide me with the full card number so that I could at least use it online for other purchases. They failed to respond. I have the receipt from BK, but it only shows the last 4 numbers. There isnt a way of contacting happy cards customer service online that I could figure out. I wish Id just stuck with credit cards.

I recommend them.',' After I bought several I realized I could have sent gift money via text without the fees or wait.',' Those who already have everything, they can buy an audible book, an old rerun of a favorite movie, some little thing they may want, or whatever as a gift for any occasion. I recommend.',' Arrived on time, in perfect shape, and best of all the person receiving the gift can buy whatever they want. One size fits all!',' Made holiday shopping easy!', 'Usually I either receive an Amazon gift card as a birthday andor Christmas gift or I purchase them at a store. Then its very easy to add the amount to my gift card balance using my cell phone. Well I was stuck inside for several days due to a blizzard and I bought quite a few books then due to a travel ban I could not go to the store to purchase a gift card.<br >So after checking my Gift Card Balance I saw that I had overindulged and it needed to be topped up. One of the options under Manage Your Balance was to Reload Your Balance. I had never used this option but decided to try it. It was so easy to do and I didnt have to leave the comfort of my home. I will be using it again in the future.',' Love my card!!', 'Itu2019s easy to use and very convenient. I would definitely consider refill more in the future',' Very easy to use.
